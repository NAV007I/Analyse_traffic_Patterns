Objective:To analyze traffic patterns, vehicle performance, and energy consumption in futuristic smart cities using machine learning. 
The ultimate goal is to build a predictive model that estimates energy consumption based on traffic features like speed, weather, vehicle type, economic conditions, and time.

tools_used:
Python
Pandas (data manipulation)
NumPy (numerical computations)
Seaborn / Matplotlib (visualization)
scikit-learn (ML models and preprocessing)

Summary_steps:
-Import Libraries
-Load the Dataset
-Initial Exploration
-Check for Missing & Duplicate Values
-Sample the Dataset (for performance)
-Data Visualization
-Encode Categorical Features
-Feature Selection
-Split Data into Train & Test
-Standardize Numerical Features
-Train Machine Learning Models
-Evaluate Model Performance

Key_Insights:
Speed and Hour of Day have strong correlations with energy consumption.
Random Forest outperformed Linear Regression with higher R² score and lower MSE.
Data had no missing or duplicate values — good for clean modeling.
AI techniques can improve energy predictions in futuristic smart city environments.
